2. System validates:

   * market status
   * available margin
   * portfolio quantity
3. Order is stored in the order book.
4. Matching engine finds matching orders.
5. Trade executes and updates:

   * balances
   * margin usage
   * portfolios
6. Order status becomes **FILLED / PARTIAL / OPEN**.
